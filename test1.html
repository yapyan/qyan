                           Legal age ka na kaya wag ka na gumawa ng katangahan baka makulong ka pa loser.
                           I dont have much to say kasi nasabi ko na lahat sayo!!
                            anyways im so grateful that the universe lead me to youu.
                           If youve never caught my eye that day, I wouldnt experience the love,
                           patience, and understanding you have been giving to me all these months.
                           I know youve doubted yourself that you arent a good boyfriend
                           but I was never asking the best, even though I dont say it I 
                           always admire how you want to be the best for me.
                            Dont be too harsh on yourself baby ah!! Its your first time living too. 
                           May life be less harsh on you my super duper strong boy,
                            you always deserve the best of the best because I saw ur hardships and effortss!!
